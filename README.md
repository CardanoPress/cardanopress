# CardanoPress
A tool box of integrations for Cardano &amp; WordPress all packaged into a neat plugin.

This plugin allows you to integrate various Cardano blockchain web3 features from single sign-on with a web3 wallet such as NamiWallet or Yoroi, accepting payments for minting and interacting with the blockchain and Cardano Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

Checkout our video about the first integration with the Ronin Universe project.
